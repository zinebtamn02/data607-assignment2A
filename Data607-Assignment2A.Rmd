## Introduction

For this assignment I will collect 1–5 movie ratings from at least five people and store them in a PostgreSQL database. I will then load the data into R and create basic summaries while showing how I handle missing ratings.

The six movies I picked are:

- Matilda  
- Now You See Me  
- White Chicks  
- The Godfather  
- The Wolf of Wall Street  
- The Devil Wears Prada  

## Planned Approach

### 1) Collect the ratings
I will ask at least five people from my job to rate only the movies they have seen on a 1–5 scale. If a person has not seen a movie, they will leave it blank. I will collect responses using a spreadsheet and then copy the results into my database.

### 2) Store the data in PostgreSQL
I will use a simple, clean database design with three tables:

- `users(user_id, name)`  
- `movies(movie_id, title)`  
- `ratings(user_id, movie_id, rating)`  

The `ratings` table connects users and movies. I will include primary keys and foreign keys, and I will prevent duplicate ratings for the same user/movie. Ratings will be limited to integers from 1 to 5.

### 3) Load the data into R
In R I will connect to PostgreSQL and query the database to load the ratings into a dataframe. The dataset will have one row per rating, including the user, the movie title, and the rating number.

### 4) Handle missing ratings
In PostgreSQL, I will store missing ratings as `NULL`. 

My main approach will be:
- keep missing ratings as `NA`
- compute summary statistics using `na.rm = TRUE`
- report rating counts for each movie so averages are not misleading

### 5) Basic checks and summaries
After loading the data into R, I will make sure that
- ratings are within 1–5
- no duplicate user/movie rows exist
- how many ratings each movie received

Then I will compute
- average rating per movie 
- number of movies rated per person

## Challenges 

- Not everyone will have seen all six movies, so missing values may be common especially for the older movies.  
- People may use the 1–5 scale differently because some people rate harshly while others rate generously.  

## Next Steps

Next, I will collect survey responses, create and populate the PostgreSQL tables, and write R code to pull the data into R for summary analysis.
